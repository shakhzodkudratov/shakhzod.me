## my gear
i want to start by mentioning that windows os is only for gaming.
i can not work comfortably on it.

os:
- linux, specifically nixos distribution for the most time (previously arch linux based manjaro)
- macos, because i have macbook air m1 and love it for its ui
- windows, only for gaming

my nixos <a href="https://github.com/shakhzodkudratov/blazingly-fast" target="_blank">configs</a>

hardware:
- macbook air m1 2020, 8gb ram, 256gb storage
- pc, i5-11600, gtx 1660 super, 16gb ram, 1tb + 500gb storage

i intentionally buy weaker hardware to use it in full potential

keyboards:
- ergodox ez, black, blank keycaps, no rgb, gateron clear (previously cherry mx brown) switches
- ~hyperx alloy origins core tkl, rgb, cherry mx red~

keyboard layout:
- programmer dvorak

my current ergodox ez <a href="https://configure.zsa.io/ergodox-ez/layouts/rPyz9/latest/0" target="_blank">config</a>.

ide:
- all jetbrains products
- sublime text
- vscode
- vim, nvim, and lvim

primarily i use jetbrains ide's just because i want to get things done faster.
i use sublime text and vscode only as a draft.
(n|l)vim for server configurations or as a config editor.

i am still trying to switch completely on (n|l)vim. it is hard.

theme:
- gruvbox and nothing else

monospace font:
- jetbrains mono
