	- Leitner system (spaced repetition)
	- *Benefits of Flashcards:*
		1. *Active Retrieval:* Flashcards help trigger active retrieval of knowledge, enhancing memory and retention.
		2. *Effective Spacing:* Flashcards make it easy to space out repetitions, allowing you to review material at the fact or concept level.
		3. *Micro-Learning:* Flashcards enable micro-learning, allowing you to study in short, concentrated bursts.
	- *Problems with Flashcards:*
		1. *Lower-Order Learning:* Flashcards are primarily suited for lower-order learning, such as direct recall and memorization.
		2. *Overwhelming:* Using flashcards for all your learning can lead to an overwhelming number of cards to review.
		3. *Repetitive:* Repetitive use of flashcards may lead to memorizing the cards themselves rather than the knowledge they represent.
	- *The 3-Part Split Strategy:*
		- Dr. Sung introduces a strategy to use flashcards effectively:
		1. *Targeted Review:* In your long study sessions, start by reviewing flashcards you got wrong three times in a row. Dedicate 5-10 minutes per card to consolidate knowledge and build networks.
		2. *Consolidation and Preparation:* During the week, review new material and create flashcards for facts and concepts. Focus on improving your encoding method to reduce the need for flashcards.
		3. *Preview:* Before you forget the material, use short, regular sessions to preview new information. Previewing helps you retain knowledge and prevent overwhelm.
	- *Upgrading Flashcards:*
		- Combine flashcards with related content to create higher-order questions. For instance, merge flashcards about "protein synthesis" and "hormone reception" into a new question like "How do hormones influence protein synthesis?"
