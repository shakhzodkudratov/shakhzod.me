## about me
my name is shakhzod. i was born and grew up in uzbekistan.

i love to listen to the music and sometimes to play a guitar.

my journey as a software developer started back in 2013.
i remember installing forum and blog engines locally.
wordpress, torrentpier, xenforo, ipboard, phpbb, and many more.

later i learnt html and css. i was converting .psd templates to interactive websites.
that time i knew, html and css is not about programming at all.
this thought was for a long time in my mind and it managed me to continue exploring
different programming languages and technologies.

then i met javascript. yes, i was using js for interactive parts on my projects.
but everything i wrote before was installing and calling ready-to-use plugins.

it was hard to me to come up with js back then. being alone without any support
was frustrating. i spent a lot of time dealing with countless errors and
realizing what was wrong.
