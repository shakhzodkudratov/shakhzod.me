## about me
my name is shakhzod. i was born and grew up in uzbekistan.

i love to listen to the music and sometimes to play a guitar.
i wrote some tracks using ai tools before. briefly speaking, my hobby is
anything related to music.

### beginning
my journey as a software developer started back in 2013.
i remember configuring forum and blog engines locally.
wordpress, torrentpier, xenforo, ipboard, phpbb, and many more.

later i learnt html and css. i was converting .psd templates to interactive websites.
that time i knew, html and css is not about programming at all.
this thought was for a long time in my mind and it managed me to continue exploring
different programming languages and technologies.

### tasting the superhero abilities
then i met javascript. yes, i was using js for interactive parts on my projects.
but everything i wrote before was installing and calling ready-to-use plugins.

it was hard to me to come up with js back then. being alone without any support
was frustrating. i spent a lot of time dealing with countless errors and
realizing what was wrong.

i watched video courses about javascript and understand literally nothing.
only thing that helped me to actually use it was a hackathon in 2016.
it gave me a huge motivation and vision. since then i became more than a
ui developer.

sample projects from that days (2016-2018):

- <a href="/archive/calendar/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">calendar</a>
- <a href="/archive/treeviewextended/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tree view extended</a>
- <a href="https://gitlab.com/shakhzodkudratov/kit10-telegrambot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">school schedule telegram bot</a>

node.js projects, backend, telegram bot, angular.js, electron, mongodb, laravel, vue.js.
i learnt these technologies after experimenting with and tasting the javascript.

## hardcore mode activated
in 2020 i decided to be independent from parents. got offer from a company,
and it was my first experience working in the office.
